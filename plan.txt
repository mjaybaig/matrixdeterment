OUTPUT: Inverse of a matrix
INPUT: Matrix of size nxn

-Matrix used is an 2 dimensional array.
Basic algorithm for finding the inverse:
    -Find the determinant of the matrix
    -Find the adjoint matrix of the matrix
    -multiply the reciprocal of the determinant with each element in the adjoint matrix

Finding the determinant of the matrix:
	-We have an nxn matrix
	-if n is greater than two,(atleast 3x3)
		-make an n-1xn-1 matrix of all the elements except those in the same row/column as A01.
		-repeat for all elements upto A0n
		-for all of the matrices made (Ie the number of columns)
			-send each of these matrixes to the deteminent function again
        -else if n equals two, 
		-Det = A00*A11 - A10*A01
		-return the determinant
	-else inform user the matrix has to be atleast 2x2		



Determinant 2:
   If the matrix > 2x2
        multiply the first element with the determinant of the minor
	repeat with all elements in first row
	add them up
   IF matrix is 2x2
	determinant is the thingy
